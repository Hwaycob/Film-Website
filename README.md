# Film-Website
A repository for a film website diary where you can save the movies and shows you watch.

This website is dedicated to people who love to record movies, TV shows/series, and films that they watch on any platform.

The user has the ability to rate the movies or shows to provide feedback on them by giving stars, reviews and more.

Anyone can use this application and their saved movies or shows are stored in a database secured specifically for the user meaning they have to login to access them.

Another feature to add: A Movie Recommendation Generator based on the user input of categories/genres they want to watch, with an algorithm that also considers the user's saved movies/shows.
